# AI Structure Prediction for Protein Complexes

This repository contains the code and documentation for an MSc-level bioinformatics project focused on predicting the structure of protein complexes using advanced computational tools like AlphaFold2. The project aims to accurately model protein-ligand complexes, specifically targeting the p300 protein and its interactions with various transcription factors.

## Project Overview

Protein-ligand complexes are crucial for cellular functions, and understanding their structures is key to deciphering biological processes, drug discovery, and treating various diseases. This project leverages computational predictions, experimental data, and collaborative approaches to improve the accuracy of these models.
